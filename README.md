What?
=====
This is a fork of trayfreq. It provides two icons in your system tray; one for your battery and one for your CPU.
Hover the mouse over each for information, or right click the CPU to switch governors and frequencies.
Simple.


Installation
------------
For ArchLinux: [Paramano on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paramano/).

For other distros, you'll likely want to install Paramano using your package manager, creating a package if one doesn't exist in your distro's repositories.

In most cases a simple workflow like "make && make install" is all that is needed.


Dependencies
------------

* gtk3
* sudo


Building
========
Due to KISS, I don't tend to use `./configure` scripts for relatively small programs.
The sort of parameters you might pass to a `./configure` can instead be passed to make.

Here's a list:

* BINDIR to override default binary directory (`/usr/bin`) for paramano and paramano-set
* PREFIX to prefix all paths with something
* SHAREDIR to override default of `/usr/share/`
* LOCALEDIR to override default of `SHAREDIR/locale`
* SUDO to override default sudo program `BINDIR/sudo`
* MAKE to override default make program `make`
* CC to override default compiler `gcc`
* PARAMANO_SET to override default paramano-set program of `BINDIR/paramano-set`
* DESTDIR (only for `make install`)


FAQ
===
Changing the governor/frequency doesn't work!
---------------------------------------------
You need root permissions to change the governor or frequency.
Paramano will detect if it's not being run as root, and attempt to use sudo to elevate any calls to `paramano-set` to root.
However, this requires passwordless sudo access to `paramano-set`.
Here is an example for the user `alice`:

    # ... (/etc/sudoers)
	alice ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/paramano-set
	# ...

You might like to make a group if you have numerous users who you wish to grant this permission.

Changing just frequency doesn't work
------------------------------------
Hardware varies greatly, and some CPUs won't let you set the frequency directly.
In such cases, you will simply have to make do with the governors exposed
through cpufreq to paramano.
